Zf Mini Projet
=============

version 1.0

## Introduction
A project developed for the ZendFramework course at ESGI school in Paris

## Environment
It works with an environment based on `Docker`

## Good to know before running project

I've created a contact page with [zend-mail](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-mail/) components but I didn't have time to configure `SMTP mail server` in my `Docker` container <br>
Of course, it might be a good improvement for the next release
